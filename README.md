## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [Vite](https://reactjs.org/) - FrontEnd Tooling
- [Reset CSS Styled Components](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned that centering a container could be this easy, see snippet below

```css
body {
  background: var(--bg-clr-300);
  font-family:  var(--ff-body);
  font-size: var(--fs-body);
  font-weight: var(--fw-regular);
  text-align: center;

  /* Project-Based-only */
  display: grid;
  place-content: center;
  margin: 0 2rem;
}
```

### Continued development

I really want to focus more on combining the process of using git and github, Front-end tools like vite and really master my CSS before moving forward with REACT
